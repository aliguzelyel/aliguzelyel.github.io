# Personal Website: aliguzelyel.github.io

I created this website using HTML and CSS. Included in it are links to my Resume, LinkedIn page, GitHub page and projects. I have also added my photo and an email-me button.

I named it 'The Portal to Internships.' It was first created on Summer 2020.

Top-to-bottom description:

1) At the top is my name, hovering over it will make my photo appear and change the text color.

2) Below is the navigation bar, clicking on the items will scroll down to the particular topic.

3) Then I have a 'Welcome' part, which has a text on the left and a box with text on the right.

4) Next is the 'about me' part. Here I have text to describe myself, and button-links to my LinkedIn and GitHub pages and resume. The resume is downloadable and it is stored in the github repo.

5) 'Projects' part is the links to specific projects I want to show to the viewer. All projects are on Github, and the links work.

6) 'Contacts' part is my general contact info. Name, location, and email are written here as text.

7) On the bottom we have a 'copyright' section, which doesn't mean anything for now :D. 

8) There is a 'email-me' button on the right side as you can see. Clicking it will give you the option to email me directly.

I tried checking accessibility: tab works well, links have their name. The photo does not have an alternate-name though.
